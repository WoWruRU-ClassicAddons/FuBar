This is a FuBar 2.0 plugin which catagorizes all inventory and bank items by tradeskill. 
Skills can be turned on and off in the menu. Items which appear yellow are gatherable items,
otherwise they appear light blue. The number columns are inventory (white),bank (yellow), and
total (green). 
Item data is saved per character. Inventory items are only scanned when the plugin is shown,
to keep down memory/processing. 
This plugin uses PeriodicTable for category look ups, it is included.
